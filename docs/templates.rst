Templates
=========

`pinax-ratings` comes with one template that is a minimal snippet that gets rendered
from the template tags for displaying the rating form.


_script.html
------------

This is a snippet that renders the bundled Javascript and a simple AJAX posting and
hooking up of a rating UI. This is optional and overridable by the site developer.
